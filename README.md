# **Corner Grocer Inventory Management**

## **Overview**

The **Corner Grocer Inventory Management** program helps small grocery stores analyze their inventory by tracking the frequency of purchased items. The program provides an interactive menu for users to:

- Search for an item's frequency.
- View a complete list of item frequencies.
- Display a histogram of item frequencies.
- Save and read data from backup files.

This project demonstrates best practices in C++ development, including modular design, input validation, and case-insensitive handling of user inputs.

---

## **Features**

- **Search for an Item**: Search for any item in the inventory, regardless of case (e.g., "zucchini" or "ZUCCHINI").
- **Frequency List**: Display all items and their purchase counts.
- **Histogram Visualization**: Generate a histogram to visualize item frequencies.
- **Data Backup**: Automatically creates a backup file (`frequency.dat`) to store inventory data.
- **Case-Insensitive Input**: Handles user input seamlessly, even if capitalization differs.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into multiple files for modularity and maintainability:

```
CornerGrocer/
├── Input_File.txt # Input file containing purchased items
├── frequency.dat # Backup file storing item frequencies (generated by the program)
├── ItemFrequency.h # Header file for the ItemFrequency class
├── ItemFrequency.cpp # Implementation file for the ItemFrequency class
├── main.cpp # Main program entry point
└── README.md # Project documentation
```

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up and run the program locally.

## **Prerequisites**

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
- Input file (`Input_File.txt`) with a list of purchased items (provided in this repository).

## **Setup**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jestercruz/GroceryTracking.git
   cd corner-grocer
   ```

Ensure Input_File.txt is present in the project directory. This file should contain a list of purchased items, one item per line.

### Compiling the Program

Using g++:

```bash
g++ -o CornerGrocer main.cpp ItemFrequency.cpp
```

### Using Visual Studio:

Open the project in Visual Studio.
Add ItemFrequency.h, ItemFrequency.cpp, and main.cpp to the project.
Build the solution.

### Running the Program

After compiling, run the executable:

```bash
./CornerGrocer
```

## How to Use

- Run the Program: Launch the program to see the menu.
- Select an Option:
  - Enter `1` to search for an item.
  - Enter `2` to display all item frequencies.
  - Enter `3` to view a histogram of frequencies.
  - Enter `4` to exit the program.

### Search for an Item:

- Type the name of the item (case-insensitive).
- The program will display the item's frequency.

### View Frequencies or Histogram:

- Select the appropriate menu option to view data.

### Example Outputs

Menu Interface

Menu:

1. Search for an item
2. Display all item frequencies
3. Display histogram
4. Exit

Enter your choice:

### Search Example

Input:

```
Enter the item to search for: zucchini
```

Output:

```
Zucchini: 5 times
```

### Histogram Example

```
Zucchini          *****
Apples            ***
Bananas           **
```

## Customization

Modify Input_File.txt to add or update purchased items.
Customize histogram symbols (e.g., use # instead of \*) in ItemFrequency::displayHistogram().
