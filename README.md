# **Corner Grocer Inventory Management**

## **Overview**

The **Corner Grocer Inventory Management** program helps the small grocery store analyze its inventory by tracking the frequency of purchased items. The program provides an interactive menu for users to:

- Search for an item to display its frequency.
- View a complete list of item frequencies.
- Display a "histogram" of item frequencies.
- Save and read data from backup files.

This project demonstrates best practices in C++ development, including modular design, input validation, and case-insensitive handling of user inputs.

## **Reflection**

### **What problem was this project solving?**
This project was designed to help a small grocery store analyze its inventory data by calculating item frequencies. It automates tracking which items were purchased most frequently, allowing store owners to make data-driven decisions about stock management. The program provides text-based visualization, making the data easier to interpret.

### **What did you do particularly well?**
I excelled in making the program modular and maintainable by separating the logic into multiple files (`ItemFrequency.h`, `ItemFrequency.cpp`, and `main.cpp`). This approach improves readability and allows future developers to easily navigate and extend the project. I also incorporated input validation and case-insensitive handling to enhance user experience.

### **Where could you enhance your code?**
While the program is functional, there are areas where it could be improved:
1. **Efficiency**: 
   - The current implementation reads the input file sequentially. Adding a caching mechanism could improve performance for larger datasets.
2. **Security**:
   - The program assumes the input file is formatted correctly. Adding error handling for incorrectly formatted files or invalid data would make it more secure.
3. **Expandability**:
   - The histogram feature could be enhanced with graphical output using a library like `matplotlib-cpp` or integrating with a GUI framework for a richer user experience.

These improvements would make the program faster, safer, and more user-friendly.

### **Which pieces of the code were most challenging, and how did you overcome them?**
The most challenging part of the project was implementing a case-insensitive search while ensuring the data's original capitalization. To overcome this, I used a combination of STL `std::map` for efficient lookups and the `std::transform` function for string manipulation. Online resources, such as C++ documentation and forums like Stack Overflow, were very helpful in finding examples for case handling.

### **What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**
- **Documentation**: The C++ Standard Library reference documentation became a go-to resource for STL usage.
- **Communities**: Stack Overflow discussion forums provided solutions for a lot of the programming challenges.
- **Local Tools**: I’m now using Visual Studio Code with Markdown Preview extensions to document projects and Visual Studio to write and debug C++ code.

### **What skills from this project are transferable to other projects or coursework?**
- **Modular Design**: Dividing code into separate files for classes will be useful for larger-scale projects.
- **Input Validation**: Implementing user input validation ensures robustness and user-friendliness.
- **File I/O Handling**: Reading from and writing to files is a common requirement in software development, and this project honed my skills in handling file operations.

### **How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
- **Maintainable**: By separating functionality into header and implementation files, I followed industry best practices, ensuring the program is easy to extend and debug.
- **Readable**: Clear naming conventions, inline comments, and consistent formatting make the code accessible to other developers.
- **Adaptable**: The modular structure and use of STL containers like `std::map` make it easy to add new features, such as additional data visualizations or different file formats.

## **Features**

- **Search for an Item**: Search for any item in the inventory, regardless of case (e.g., "zucchini" or "ZUCCHINI").
- **Frequency List**: Display all items and their purchase counts.
- **Histogram Visualization**: Generate a histogram to visualize item frequencies.
- **Data Backup**: Automatically creates a backup file (`frequency.dat`) to store inventory data.
- **Case-Insensitive Input**: Handles user input seamlessly, even if capitalization differs.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into multiple files for modularity and maintainability:

```
GroceryTracking/
├── Input_File.txt # Input file containing purchased items
├── frequency.dat # Backup file storing item frequencies (generated by the program)
├── ItemFrequency.h # Header file for the ItemFrequency class
├── ItemFrequency.cpp # Implementation file for the ItemFrequency class
├── main.cpp # Main program entry point
└── README.md # Project documentation
```

---

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up and run the program locally.

## **Prerequisites**

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
- Input file (`Input_File.txt`) with a list of purchased items (provided in this repository).

## **Setup**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jestercruz/GroceryTracking.git
   cd GroceryTracking
   ```

Ensure Input_File.txt is present in the project directory. This file should contain a list of purchased items, one item per line.

### Compiling the Program

Using g++:

```bash
g++ -o GroceryTracker main.cpp ItemFrequency.cpp
```

### Using Visual Studio:

Open the project in Visual Studio.
Add ItemFrequency.h, ItemFrequency.cpp, and main.cpp to the project.
Build the solution.

### Running the Program

After compiling, run the executable:

```bash
./GroceryTracker
```

## How to Use

- Run the Program: Launch the program to see the menu.
- Select an Option:
  - Enter `1` to search for an item.
  - Enter `2` to display all item frequencies.
  - Enter `3` to view a histogram of frequencies.
  - Enter `4` to exit the program.

### Search for an Item:

- Type the name of the item (case-insensitive).
- The program will display the item's frequency.

### View Frequencies or Histogram:

- Select the appropriate menu option to view data.

### Example Outputs

Menu Interface

Menu:

1. Search for an item
2. Display all item frequencies
3. Display histogram
4. Exit

Enter your choice:

### Search Example

Input:

```
Enter the item to search for: zucchini
```

Output:

```
Zucchini: 5 times
```

### Histogram Example

```
Zucchini          *****
Apples            ***
Bananas           **
```

## Customization

Modify Input_File.txt to add or update purchased items.
Customize histogram symbols (e.g., use # instead of \*) in ItemFrequency::displayHistogram().
